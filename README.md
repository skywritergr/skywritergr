# Hey there! 👋

I'm George, an Engineer based in London. I build things that help people occassionally move money, other times making sure networks work correctly or little tools that solve my own problems.

## What I Do 💼

I lead engineering teams while keeping my hands firmly in the code – because the best way to understand your team's challenges is to face them yourself. My stack spans the full spectrum: React and Vue.js on the frontend, Node.js, Python, and Java on the backend, with occasional AWS adventures to keep things interesting.

Previously, I spent time at [ThousandEyes (Cisco)](https://thousandeyes.com), [OakNorth](https://www.oaknorth.com/), helped [Wise](https://wise.com) move money across borders, and worked on systems at [Disney](https://disney.co.uk/) and [Cerner](https://www.cerner.com/).

## Currently Tinkering With 🔨

**[UK Rental Property Tax Calculator](https://tax-calculator.stefanis.dev/main.html)** – A side project born from necessity (and my inability to understand HMRC's documentation). It's a couples-focused financial planning tool that helps UK landlords navigate the byzantine world of rental property taxation without losing their minds.

**Movie finder** – My answer to "what was the best movie from 1994?" Originally built in 2020 to settle endless arguments about film years. [Read about it on dev.to](https://dev.to/stefanisg/completing-a-side-project-presenting-avcud-1f1k). If you have thoughts, hit me up on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/stefanis.dev) – feedback genuinely appreciated!

Want updates on my projects? I occasionally remember to send updates via [my newsletter](https://stefanisg.substack.com).

## Writing & Thinking ✍️

I blog sporadically at [georgestefanis.com](https://www.georgestefanis.com/) about engineering, leadership, and workplace culture. I also have a podcast in Greek called [BadGuys](https://www.badguys.fm/).

## Random Accomplishments 🏆

* **2nd Place, TechCrunch Disrupt London 2015** – Built [MedicSMS](https://devpost.com/software/medicsms), first aid diagnosis for the developing world via SMS
* **3rd Place, TechCrunch Disrupt London 2016** – Created [RefuTweet](https://devpost.com/software/refutweet) with the same excellent team
* **Console Resurrectionist** – I fix old gaming hardware for fun. Here's me [bringing a Gameboy back to life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLtr4vd6cb8)

## When Not Coding 🎯

You'll find me cycling around London (or on Zwift when British weather strikes), cooking elaborate Greek-inspired dinners, training for marathons (currently targeting Copenhagen Marathon May 2025), or obsessing over my European-minimalist wardrobe aesthetic.
