### Hi there üëã
My name is George and I am a software developer currently based in London. I've been working mostly on the frontend but I often enjoy having some backend and devops adventures. I love cooking, taking photos of things and running.

### Building things üî®
Lately I've been re-working [avcud.com](https://avcud.com), a website I made on 2020 to help me find the best movie for each year. I wrote about it [on dev.to](https://dev.to/stefanisg/completing-a-side-project-presenting-avcud-1f1k). If you have some feedback on it please hit me on Twitter, I'd love to know.

If you want to follow on the development I also have a newsletter where I sporadigly send updates. [Subsribe here!](https://avcud.substack.com/)

I am also currently working at [ThousandEyes(part of Cisco)](https://thousandeyes.com) monitoring all the networks. Before that I was working for [Oaknorth](https://www.oaknorth.com/), [Wise](https://wise.com/), [Disney](https://disney.co.uk/) and [Cerner](https://www.cerner.com/).
